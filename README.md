Implementing the KNN and Understanding the Outliers Handling

Detecting outliers in a classification problem involves identifying data points
that deviate significantly from the other observations in the dataset. These outliers can potentially affect the performance of  classification model.

Univariate Analysis:
- *Box Plots:* Create box plots for each feature. Points outside the whiskers of the box plot are considered potential outliers.
- *Z-Scores:* Calculate the Z-score for each feature. Data points with a Z-score above a certain threshold (typically 3 or -3) are considered outliers.

 2. *Multivariate Analysis*
- *Mahalanobis Distance:* Measures the distance of a point from the mean of a distribution, considering the correlations of the data. High Mahalanobis distances indicate potential outliers.
- *Isolation Forest:* An algorithm specifically designed for outlier detection. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

3. *Density-Based Methods*
- *Local Outlier Factor (LOF):* Measures the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. Points with a lower density compared to their neighbors are considered outliers.
- *DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):* A clustering algorithm that can identify points in low-density regions as outliers.

4. *Model-Based Methods*
- *One-Class SVM:* A type of SVM used for outlier detection. It tries to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points from the origin.
- *Ensemble Methods:* Combining multiple outlier detection algorithms to improve accuracy and robustness.

5. *Visual Inspection*
- *Scatter Plots:* Plot pairs of features and look for points that are far away from others.
- *PCA (Principal Component Analysis):* Reduce the dimensionality of the data to two or three components and visualize it. Outliers will appear as points far from the main cluster.

6. *Domain-Specific Rules*
- *Business Rules:* Sometimes, domain knowledge can define what constitutes an outlier. For example, in a financial dataset, transactions over a certain amount may be considered outliers based on business rules.
